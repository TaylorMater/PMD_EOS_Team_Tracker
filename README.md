# Overview

## General Description

I wanted to test my abilities to scrape data, and scraped data pertaining to IQ groups from Serebii for pokemon from the Pkemon Mystery Dungeon 2 games. The scraper, using BeautifulSoup, is more or less developed here. More scraping can be done if I need it, but this was purely for me to play with. Most of the other scripts are remnants of my test work.
