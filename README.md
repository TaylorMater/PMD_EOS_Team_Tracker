# Overview

## General Description

I recently had a weekend free and was able to relive the nostalgia from my childhood that was Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Explorers of Sky. I started putting a team together, and I wanted to get really invested with everyone on my team - I wanted to be able to give recruits longer nicknames/change them as needed, I wanted to be able to give them merits/ranks so I could connect with them more, I wanted to track my pokedex progress (at least in my interpretation of it, compared to the methods in which the game defines them), and also reference various pokemon stats/data from the game - notably IQ groups, IQ group skills, and more. Initially I was tracking the data manually in a text file that had a JSON-like structure until I realized that I could probably handle this data way better if I could populate a database with the relevant info and skeletonize some tables with the right columns. 

At the same time, I have been wanting to flex my mental muscles and tie a bunch of knowledge together. So I came up with a plan:

0. Figure out what data we want
1. Develop a scraper
2. Scrape the data
3. Store the data in a database
4. Develop scripts to access, update, and manipulate data with minimal input
5. ...

More plans down the road if I have time, but this seems like a nice passion project to work on.
