using the conda pmd_tracker environment that has the proper versioning


1. Finish test scrape for 1 pokemon:
    a. Learn how to parse the html output to get all the fields we need for our reference dex
    b. note that the size isn't really scrapable - the value is stored as an image. I might be able to count the occurences of said images, but that seems gross and it's small enough of a subset that I could edit those values into the database manually.

    Check about ATI bill. Pay if needed.


2. Finish the dex_reference_scraper.py to write the results of the scrape to a csv in the proper format
    a. Need to also grab pokemon name and types, 
3. Create a public git repo for everything.
4. Import the csv into a table in pgadmin for the pmd_team_tracker database.
    a. The table will be called: dex_reference
5. Write a script that runs the sql query to find the pokmeon by name from this database
    a. Literally just a SELECT * WHERE NAME = '<pokemon_name>' but with connection string/database connection handling
6. Create a website that pulls data from this database and displays it
